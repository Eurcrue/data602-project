## Current Plan

### Data Preparation

Data was taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2024/data). The first step is to somehow join Regular Season data with Tournament data. This will require some sort of aggregation/summary of Regular Season data per team so that it may be compared with Tournament Results. Measures of center and spread will be considered for each statistic collected during the regular season. Then we will join this on a team by team basis to tournament results.
